# Python-Time series modelling collection

This repositories contains my work in testing different time series techniques to apply them on dataset available in public. The objective of code building in this repository is to study deep learning in theory and test out its application to compare or add values in traditional time series forecast.

The data use on this time series is Airpassenger that you can download from Kaggle ;

### 1. Recursive Nerual Network

The first test is on 

RNN : Sequential data. One to one, one to many, many to one, many to many.
Problem in RNN can be overcome by LSTM

### 2. LSTM
